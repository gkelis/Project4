In Project 4 we had to further develop our Shopping Cart (basket) created in line
of Project 3 using the struts framework, javabeans and tag libraries.

Steps for successful deployment:
1) Install Apache Tomcat
2) Extract the p4 folder into the 
	“installation_directory\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0\webapps” directory
3) Start (or restart) Tomcat service
4) Enter " http://localhost:8080/p4 " in the address bar of any web browser
5) Start playing with your Shopping Cart!!!

The source code of the .java files is located in the "src\java\beans" directory.
